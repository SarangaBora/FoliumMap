BUS ROUTE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Implemented a Bus Route recommendation system with hard coded Bus stops on a selected map area and implemented BFS algo to find shortest routes along with alternatives and list them out to user. 
Used Folium library to visualize a real map area and create markers with accurate co ordinates.
